    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another very simple, kids card game,  &lt;strong&gt;Play Ball&lt;/strong&gt; by Gamewright released in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;model-viewer class=&quot;model-viewer&quot; src=&quot;./play-ball-gamewright.glb&quot; ios-src=&quot;./play-ball-gamewright.usdz&quot; poster=&quot;./play-ball-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Play Ball 3D Model scan&quot; camera-controls=&quot;&quot; ar=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;eager&quot;&gt;&lt;/model-viewer&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the sharpie on the box, looks like it was listed for $1 at the thrift store, and that one that likes to mark on the boxes with sharpie, usually has 50% board games.  We have had this for a long while, but I&#39;d bet I actually picked this up for $0.50.  You take the good (prices), with the bad (sharpie marks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the box you have a deck 55 playing card size cards and the instructions.  There are 42 team cards (think suits), 7 wild cards, and 6 action cards; 2 each of Time Out, Pinch Hitter, and Yer Out! cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game lays out 3 different games that can be played with the same deck: Field of Teams, Hard Ball Nine, and Nine on the Field.  Hard Ball Nine and Nine on the Field are matching games and light adding games for very young kids, so we have never actually played those variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/play-ball/7Dvhg3iqCP-3948.avif 3948w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/play-ball/7Dvhg3iqCP-3948.webp 3948w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/play-ball/7Dvhg3iqCP-3948.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;gif-viewer&quot; alt=&quot;A jpg showing Play Ball on a table&quot; width=&quot;3948&quot; height=&quot;2462&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Field of Teams variant is still a basic adding game, laid on top of a Rummy style set game.  You can play cards from your hand that are the same suit (color) and their numbers equal up to 9.  Once you play a set from all 4 colors, you are the winner.   It&#39;s not too in depth, but it&#39;s just enough to take out and play on occasion.  It also helps that games rarely last much longer than about 10 minutes.  It&#39;s an easy game to explain, easy to get to the table, and easy to play with kids.  And it doesn&#39;t hurt to get out games with the baseball theme during baseball season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/play-ball/9EDcQJ6467-282.webp 282w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/play-ball/9EDcQJ6467-282.gif&quot; class=&quot;gif-viewer&quot; alt=&quot;A gif showing a play Play Ball in action&quot; width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-final-say&quot;&gt;The Final Say&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the final say will be one of the following: It&#39;s a Keeper, Just Okay, Not Worth Picking Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I buy again?  For $0.50, absolutely.  Any more than about $5 and I don&#39;t think I would lay the money down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Setup&lt;/strong&gt;: Easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Friendly&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, works for all ages down to young ages.  Basic addition math skills is the main requirement, a great introduction to Rummy-like games for young kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replayability&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, but as kids age it&#39;ll wain for games with more strategic depth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the final say is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Say&lt;/strong&gt;: Just Okay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Funny Bones</title>
    <link href="https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/funny-bones/" />
    <updated>2025-04-28T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, our first game is &lt;strong&gt;Funny Bones&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;model-viewer class=&quot;model-viewer&quot; src=&quot;./Funny-Bones.glb&quot; ios-src=&quot;./Funny-Bones.usdz&quot; poster=&quot;./funny-bones.png&quot; alt=&quot;Funny Bones 3D Model scan&quot; camera-controls=&quot;&quot; ar=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;eager&quot;&gt;&lt;/model-viewer&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the box is in decent condition.  It has some torn edges, random tape, and a few rips here and there.  Really, not too bad for a game from 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the box we have just a deck of large cards.  That&#39;s it.  No instructions included, with just a light bit of explainer text on the back of the box.  That&#39;s okay, each card has a point value on it, and we can make our own house rules and judgements as needed.  That&#39;s part of the fun, thrill, hunt, and challenge of thrift store gaming.  You don&#39;t get it all, all the time, but the price and the exploration generally make the gamble worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;model-viewer class=&quot;model-viewer&quot; src=&quot;./funny-bones-on-table.glb&quot; ios-src=&quot;./funny-bones-on-table.usdz&quot; poster=&quot;./funny-bones.png&quot; alt=&quot;Funny Bones 3D Model scan&quot; camera-controls=&quot;&quot; ar=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;eager&quot; ar-placement=&quot;wall&quot;&gt;&lt;/model-viewer&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it fun?&lt;/strong&gt;
Yes, yes it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve played this with kids and at family functions with a mixed group of kids and adults.  Clearly by the artwork the expectation is that you&#39;d play this game at a 60s adult dinner party.  While I think that could be fun, it may be a bit awkward to play this with any that isn&#39;t your direct spouse / significant other.  But hey, maybe playing this game would be a great way to meet said spouse or significant other if you are single?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve generally house ruled that there is a 3rd person that is handing the next card off the deck to the 2 players playing.  This allows them to focus a bit more of keeping cards held between all the random connected body parts, giving them a chance to score a bit higher than if they had to move and bend to pickup another card from the deck themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center-image&quot;&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/funny-bones/bniXpfM9Cj-282.webp 282w&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/funny-bones/bniXpfM9Cj-282.gif&quot; class=&quot;gif-viewer&quot; alt=&quot;A gif showing Funny Bones with the pieces in play&quot; width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-final-say&quot;&gt;The Final Say&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final say will be one of the following: It&#39;s a Keeper, Just Okay, Not Worth Picking Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I buy again?  100%.  It has provided a few hours of entertainment, and for the purchase price of a few dollars, it is an easy win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Setup&lt;/strong&gt;: Easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Friendly&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, works for all ages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replayability&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, a quick hit party game you could play anytime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the final say is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Say&lt;/strong&gt;: It&#39;s a Keeper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <link href="https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/introduction/" />
    <updated>2025-04-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://gameswehaveplayed.com/blog/introduction/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Howdy folks, my name is Justin and I like board games.  Buying board games at thrift stores, is a 2-for-1 hobby of mine.  Playing the board games is great and all, but I just might like the thrill of the hunt of buying another board game from a thrift store for a deal even better.  I have too many games and not enough plays.  So what shall we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is a personal effort to start playing more of those board games regularly, and sharing my thoughts as well.  Why start a written blog?  Well, I listen to the occasional podcast about board games, but I very much struggle watching video reviews.  Too long, didn&#39;t watch I guess.  I do, however, like the text reviews on BGG, so this will be in that vein.  I&#39;ll likely also post these reviews there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the plain text, as I realize that will be a hair boring, is 3D scanning via Apple&#39;s Reality Composer.  It seems that can be a fun way to show the exact game I have, and it&#39;s state as bought, as some of the boxes can be beat up, torn, etc as you might imagine from the thrift store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in addition to the text and 3D scans, animated gifs are another nice way to balance that need to see components in action, but not needing to be a full video, so you&#39;ll see those too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recap: Board games, thrift store, 3D scans, and animated gifs.  That is what you can expect, I hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, welcome to &lt;strong&gt;Games We Have Played&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the basement game room collection in all it&#39;s glory.  This is about the most organized it has been in quite a while.  Enjoy the (mostly) lack of games on the floor and generally shelved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow along as I share my adventures on getting games to the table, scanning them in 3D, animating some gifs and writing some light reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
