Hello, my name is Justin and I like board games.  I really like getting board games at thrift stores.  I really enjoy playing board games, but I just might like the thrill of the hunt of getting another board game from a thrift store for a deal.  I have too many games and not enough plays.  So what shall we do?  

This blog is a personal effort to start playing more of those board games regularly, and sharing my thoughts as well.  Why start a written blog?  Well, I listen to the occasional podcast about board games, but I very much struggle watching video reviews.  Too long, didn't watch I guess.  I do, however, like the text reviews on BGG, so this will be in that vein.  I'll likely also post these reviews there as well. 

Adding to the plain text, as I realize that will be a hair boring, is 3D scanning via Apple's Reality Composer.  It seems that can be a fun way to show the exact game I have, and it's state as bought, as some of the boxes can be beat up, torn, etc as you might imagine from the thrift store.

Finally, in addition to the text and 3D scans, animated gifs are another nice way to balance that need to see components in action, but not needing to be a full video, so you'll see those too.  

Recap: Board games, thrift store, 3D scans, and animated gifs.  That is what you can expect, I hope you enjoy!

Without further ado, our first game is __Funny Bones__.

As you can see the box is in decent condition.  It has some torn edges, random tape, and a few rips here and there.  Really, not too bad for a game from 1968.

In the box we have just a deck of large cards.  That's it.  No instructions included, with just a light bit of explainer text on the back of the box.  That's okay, each card has a point value on it, and we can make our own house rules and judgements as needed.  That's part of the fun, thrill, hunt, and challenge of thrift store gaming.  You don't get it all, all the time, but the price and the exploration generally make the gamble worth it.

__But is it fun?__
Yes, yes it is.

We've played this with kids and at family functions with a mixed group of kids and adults.  Clearly by the artwork the expectation is that you'd play this game at a 60s adult dinner party.  While I think that could be fun, it may be a bit awkward to play this with any that isn't your direct spouse / significant other.  But hey, maybe playing this game would be a great way to meet said spouse or significant other if you are single?

We've generally house ruled that there is a 3rd person that is handing the next card off the deck to the 2 players playing.  This allows them to focus a bit more of keeping cards held between all the random connected body parts, giving them a chance to score a bit higher than if they had to move and bend to pickup another card from the deck themselves.

__Would I buy again?__
100%.  It's provided a few hours of entertainment, and for the purchase price of a few dollars (I don't recall the exact price, as I got this several years ago at a thrift store, but definitely under $5), it is an easy win.

Enjoy!
